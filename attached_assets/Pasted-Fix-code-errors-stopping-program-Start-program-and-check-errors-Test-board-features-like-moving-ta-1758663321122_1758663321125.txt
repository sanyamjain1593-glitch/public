make a kanban board app where users can add and drap and drop items between boards, make sure to give the app a sleek and modern look that looks soo futuristic, and it should have the options of deleting the task from there itself and a history thing for the task so the task will be maintained on a daily basis and everyday task will be listed in the Kanban and history tab will be there to show the completed task so at the end of the everyday whatever the completed task that are there they will just be dropped into the history tab and whatever task that are pending or they are in progress they will just roll over to the next day

I see that the project has already been built with a comprehensive kanban board app. Now I need to test the MVP features to ensure everything is working properly. Let me first check the current status and then create a task list for testing.
we dont want a review column, replace it with a Done column instead, the tasks in which will go to history automatically at 12 midnight
